  <introduction>
    <p>
      An introduction to the hardware, software, and techniques involved with composing, 
      editing and producing digital music. The primary goal is to gain a working facility 
      and knowledge of fundamental technologies found within a modern music production environment 
      such as digital audio workstation (DAW) software, file management, mixing techniques, sound 
      editing, sequencing, sampling, sound design, and synthesis. Foremost is the creative application 
      of these skills that result in original pieces of music, sound design environments, and emulated 
      modular synthesizer design.
